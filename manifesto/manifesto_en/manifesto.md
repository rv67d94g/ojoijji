> 1848\]</span>. First published in German, it has been republished in

> in 1850 in the [Red
> Republican](http://www.marxists.org/glossary/periodicals/r/e.htm#red-republican){.calibre1},
> London, translated by Miss Helen Macfarlane, and in 1871 in at least

> However much that state of things may have altered during the last
> twenty-five years, the general principles laid down in the Manifesto
> are, on the whole, as correct today as ever. Here and there, some
> detail might be improved. The practical application of the principles
> will depend, as the Manifesto itself states, everywhere and at all
> times, on the historical conditions for the time being existing, and,
> for that reason, no special stress is laid on the revolutionary
> measures proposed at the end of [Section II](#ch02.htm){.calibre1}.
> That passage would, in many respects, be very differently worded
> today. In view of the gigantic strides of Modern Industry since 1848,
> and of the accompanying improved and extended organization of the
> working class, in view of the practical experience gained, first in
> the February Revolution, and then, still more, in the Paris Commune,
> where the proletariat for the first time held political power for two
> whole months, this programme has in some details been antiquated. One
> thing especially was proved by the Commune, viz., that “the working
> class cannot simply lay hold of the ready-made state machinery, and
> wield it for its own purposes.” (See [The Civil War in France: Address
> of the General Council of the International Working Men’ s
> Association](http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/index.htm){.calibre1},
> 1871, where this point is further developed.) Further, it is
> self-evident that the criticism of socialist literature is deficient
> in relation to the present time, because it comes down only to 1847;
> also that the remarks on the relation of the Communists to the various
> opposition parties ([Section IV](#ch04.htm){.calibre1}), although, in
> principle still correct, yet in practice are antiquated, because the
> political situation has been entirely changed, and the progress of
> history has swept from off the earth the greater portion of the
> political parties there enumerated.
>
> But then, the Manifesto has become a historical document which we have
> no longer any right to alter. A subsequent edition may perhaps appear
> with an introduction bridging the gap from 1847 to the present day;

> What a limited field the proletarian movement occupied at that time
> (December 1847) is most clearly shown by the [last
> section](#ch04.htm){.calibre1}: the position of the Communists in
> relation to the various opposition parties in various countries.
> Precisely Russia and the United States are missing here. It was the
> time when Russia constituted the last great reserve of all European
> reaction, when the United States absorbed the surplus proletarian
> forces of Europe through immigration. Both countries provided Europe
> with raw materials and were at the same time markets for the sale of
> its industrial products. Both were, therefore, in one way of another,
> pillars of the existing European system.
>
> How very different today. Precisely European immigration fitted North
> American for a gigantic agricultural production, whose competition is
> shaking the very foundations of European landed property — large and
> small. At the same time, it enabled the United States to exploit its
> tremendous industrial resources with an energy and on a scale that
> must shortly break the industrial monopoly of Western Europe, and
> especially of England, existing up to now. Both circumstances react in
> a revolutionary manner upon America itself. Step by step, the small
> and middle land ownership of the farmers, the basis of the whole
> political constitution, is succumbing to the competition of giant
> farms; at the same time, a mass industrial proletariat and a fabulous
> concentration of capital funds are developing for the first time in
> the industrial regions.
>
> And now Russia! During the Revolution of 1848-9, not only the European
> princes, but the European bourgeois as well, found their only
> salvation from the proletariat just beginning to awaken in Russian
> intervention. The Tsar was proclaimed the chief of European reaction.
> Today, he is a prisoner of war of the revolution in Gatchina
> ^[\[B\]](#preface.htm#e2){#preface.htm#eb2 .calibre1}^, and Russia
> forms the vanguard of revolutionary action in Europe.
>
> The Communist Manifesto had, as its object, the proclamation of the
> inevitable impending dissolution of modern bourgeois property. But in
> Russia we find, face-to-face with the rapidly flowering capitalist
> swindle and bourgeois property, just beginning to develop, more than
> half the land owned in common by the peasants. Now the question is:
> can the Russian
> [obshchina](http://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/o/b.htm#obshchina){.calibre1},
> though greatly undermined, yet a form of primeval common ownership of
> land, pass directly to the higher form of Communist common ownership?
> Or, on the contrary, must it first pass through the same process of
> dissolution such as constitutes the historical evolution of the West?
>
> The only answer to that possible today is this: If the Russian
> Revolution becomes the signal for a proletarian revolution in the
> West, so that both complement each other, the present Russian common
> ownership of land may serve as the starting point for a communist
> development.

> The basic thought running through the Manifesto — that economic

> political and intellectual history of that epoch; that consequently
> (ever since the dissolution of the primaeval communal ownership of
> land) all history has been a history of class struggles, of struggles
> between exploited and exploiting, between dominated and dominating
> classes at various stages of social evolution; that this struggle,
> however, has now reached a stage where the exploited and oppressed
> class (the proletariat) can no longer emancipate itself from the class
> which exploits and oppresses it (the bourgeoisie), without at the same
> time forever freeing the whole of society from exploitation,
> oppression, class struggles — this basic thought belongs solely and
> exclusively to Marx. ^[(1)](#preface.htm#a1){#preface.htm#a1b

> The Manifesto was published as the platform of the Communist League, a
> working men’ s association, first exclusively German, later on
> international, and under the political conditions of the Continent
> before 1848, unavoidably a secret society. At a Congress of the
> League, held in November 1847, Marx and Engels were commissioned to
> prepare a complete theoretical and practical party programme. Drawn up
> in German, in January 1848, the manuscript was sent to the printer in
> London a few weeks before the French Revolution of February 24. A
> French translation was brought out in Paris shortly before the
> insurrection of June 1848. The first English translation, by Miss

>
> The defeat of the Parisian insurrection of June 1848 — the first great
> battle between proletariat and bourgeoisie — drove again into the
> background, for a time, the social and political aspirations of the
> European working class. Thenceforth, the struggle for supremacy was,
> again, as it had been before the Revolution of February, solely
> between different sections of the propertied class; the working class
> was reduced to a fight for political elbow-room, and to the position
> of extreme wing of the middle-class Radicals. Wherever independent
> proletarian movements continued to show signs of life, they were
> ruthlessly hunted down. Thus the Prussian police hunted out the
> Central Board of the Communist League, then located in Cologne. The
> members were arrested and, after eighteen months’ imprisonment, they
> were tried in October 1852. This celebrated “[Cologne Communist
> Trial](http://www.marxists.org/glossary/events/c/o.htm#cologne-communist-trial){.calibre1}”
> lasted from October 4 till November 12; seven of the prisoners were
> sentenced to terms of imprisonment in a fortress, varying from three
> to six years. Immediately after the sentence, the League was formally
> dissolved by the remaining members. As to the Manifesto, it seemed
> henceforth doomed to oblivion.
>
> When the European workers had recovered sufficient strength for
> another attack on the ruling classes, the [International Working Men’
> s
> Association](http://www.marxists.org/glossary/orgs/i/n.htm#iwma){.calibre1}
> sprang up. But this association, formed with the express aim of
> welding into one body the whole militant proletariat of Europe and
> America, could not at once proclaim the principles laid down in the
> Manifesto. The International was bound to have a programme broad
> enough to be acceptable to the English trade unions, to the followers
> of
> [Proudhon](http://www.marxists.org/glossary/people/p/r.htm#proudhon){.calibre1}

> Marx, who drew up this programme to the satisfaction of all parties,
> entirely trusted to the intellectual development of the working class,
> which was sure to result from combined action and mutual discussion.
> The very events and vicissitudes in the struggle against capital, the
> defeats even more than the victories, could not help bringing home to
> men’ s minds the insufficiency of their various favorite nostrums, and
> preparing the way for a more complete insight into the true conditions
> for working-class emancipation. And Marx was right. The International,
> on its breaking in 1874, left the workers quite different men from
> what it found them in 1864. Proudhonism in France, Lassalleanism in
> Germany, were dying out, and even the conservative English trade
> unions, though most of them had long since severed their connection
> with the International, were gradually advancing towards that point at
> which, last year at Swansea, their president <span>\[W. Bevan\]</span>
> could say in their name: “Continental socialism has lost its terror
> for us.” In fact, the principles of the Manifesto had made
> considerable headway among the working men of all countries.
>
> The Manifesto itself came thus to the front again. Since 1850, the
> German text had been reprinted several times in Switzerland, England,
> and America. In 1872, it was translated into English in New York,
> where the translation was published in *Woodhull and Claflin’ s
> Weekly*. From this English version, a French one was made in *Le
> Socialiste* of New York. Since then, at least two more English
> translations, more or less mutilated, have been brought out in
> America, and one of them has been reprinted in England. The first
> Russian translation, made by Bakunin, was published at Herzen’ s
> Kolokol office in Geneva, about 1863; a second one, by the heroic Vera
> Zasulich, also in Geneva, in 1882. A new Danish edition is to be found
> in *Socialdemokratisk Bibliothek*, Copenhagen, 1885; a fresh French
> translation in *Le Socialiste*, Paris, 1886. From this latter, a
> Spanish version was prepared and published in Madrid, 1886. The German
> reprints are not to be counted; there have been twelve altogether at
> the least. An Armenian translation, which was to be published in
> Constantinople some months ago, did not see the light, I am told,
> because the publisher was afraid of bringing out a book with the name
> of Marx on it, while the translator declined to call it his own
> production. Of further translations into other languages I have heard
> but had not seen. Thus the history of the Manifesto reflects the
> history of the modern working-class movement; at present, it is
> doubtless the most wide spread, the most international production of
> all socialist literature, the common platform acknowledged by millions
> of working men from Siberia to California.
>
> Yet, when it was written, we could not have called it a *socialist*
> manifesto. By Socialists, in 1847, were understood, on the one hand
> the adherents of the various Utopian systems: Owenites in England,
> Fourierists in France, <span>\[See [Charles
> Owen](http://www.marxists.org/glossary/people/o/w.htm#owen){.calibre1}
> and [François
> Fourier](http://www.marxists.org/glossary/people/f/o.htm#fourier){.calibre1}\]</span>
> both of them already reduced to the position of mere sects, and
> gradually dying out; on the other hand, the most multifarious social
> quacks who, by all manner of tinkering, professed to redress, without
> any danger to capital and profit, all sorts of social grievances, in
> both cases men outside the working-class movement, and looking rather
> to the “educated" classes for support. Whatever portion of the working
> class had become convinced of the insufficiency of mere political
> revolutions, and had proclaimed the necessity of total social change,
> called itself Communist. It was a crude, rough-hewn, purely
> instinctive sort of communism; still, it touched the cardinal point
> and was powerful enough amongst the working class to produce the
> Utopian communism of Cabet in France, and of Weitling in Germany.
> Thus, in 1847, socialism was a middle-class movement, communism a
> working-class movement. Socialism was, on the Continent at least,
> “respectable”; communism was the very opposite. And as our notion,
> from the very beginning, was that “the emancipation of the workers
> must be the act of the working class itself,” there could be no doubt
> as to which of the two names we must take. Moreover, we have, ever
> since, been far from repudiating it.
>
> The Manifesto being our joint production, I consider myself bound to
> state that the fundamental proposition which forms the nucleus belongs
> to Marx. That proposition is: That in every historical epoch, the
> prevailing mode of economic production and exchange, and the social
> organization necessarily following from it, form the basis upon which
> it is built up, and from that which alone can be explained the
> political and intellectual history of that epoch; that consequently
> the whole history of mankind (since the dissolution of primitive
> tribal society, holding land in common ownership) has been a history
> of class struggles, contests between exploiting and exploited, ruling
> and oppressed classes; That the history of these class struggles forms
> a series of evolutions in which, nowadays, a stage has been reached
> where the exploited and oppressed class — the proletariat — cannot
> attain its emancipation from the sway of the exploiting and ruling
> class — the bourgeoisie — without, at the same time, and once and for
> all, emancipating society at large from all exploitation, oppression,
> class distinction, and class struggles.
>
> This proposition, which, in my opinion, is destined to do for history
> what Darwin’ s theory has done for biology, we both of us, had been
> gradually approaching for some years before 1845. How far I had
> independently progressed towards it is best shown by my [Conditions of

> But when I again met Marx at Brussels, in spring 1845, he had it

> From our joint preface to the [German edition of
> 1872](#preface.htm#preface-1872){.calibre1}, I quote the following:
>
> “However much that state of things may have altered during the last

> The Manifesto has had a history of its own. Greeted with enthusiasm,
> at the time of its appearance, by the not at all numerous vanguard of
> scientific socialism (as is proved by the translations mentioned in
> the first place), it was soon forced into the background by the
> reaction that began with the defeat of the Paris workers in June 1848,
> and was finally excommunicated “by law” in the conviction of the
> Cologne Communists in November 1852. With the disappearance from the
> public scene of the workers’ movement that had begun with the February
> Revolution, the Manifesto too passed into the background.
>
> When the European workers had again gathered sufficient strength for a
> new onslaught upon the power of the ruling classes, the International
> Working Men’ s Association came into being. Its aim was to weld
> together into *one* huge army the whole militant working class of
> Europe and America. Therefore it could not *set out* from the
> principles laid down in the Manifesto. It was bound to have a
> programme which would not shut the door on the English trade unions,
> the French, Belgian, Italian, and Spanish Proudhonists, and the German
> Lassalleans. This programme — the considerations underlying the
> Statutes of the International — was drawn up by Marx with a master
> hand acknowledged even by the Bakunin and the anarchists. For the
> ultimate final triumph of the ideas set forth in the Manifesto, Marx
> relied solely upon the intellectual development of the working class,
> as it necessarily has to ensue from united action and discussion. The
> events and vicissitudes in the struggle against capital, the defeats
> even more than the successes, could not but demonstrate to the
> fighters the inadequacy of their former universal panaceas, and make
> their minds more receptive to a thorough understanding of the true
> conditions for working-class emancipation. And Marx was right. The
> working class of 1874, at the dissolution of the International, was
> altogether different from that of 1864, at its foundation. Proudhonism
> in the Latin countries, and the specific Lassalleanism in Germany,
> were dying out; and even the ten arch-conservative English trade
> unions were gradually approaching the point where, in 1887, the
> chairman of their Swansea Congress could say in their name:
> “Continental socialism has lost its terror for us.” Yet by 1887
> continental socialism was almost exclusively the theory heralded in
> the Manifesto. Thus, to a certain extent, the history of the Manifesto
> reflects the history of the modern working-class movement since 1848.
> At present, it is doubtless the most widely circulated, the most
> international product of all socialist literature, the common
> programme of many millions of workers of all countries from Siberia to
> California.
>
> Nevertheless, when it appeared, we could not have called it a
> *socialist* manifesto. In 1847, two kinds of people were considered
> socialists. On the one hand were the adherents of the various utopian
> systems, notably the Owenites in England and the Fourierists in
> France, both of whom, at that date, had already dwindled to mere sects

>
> The fact that a new Polish edition of the Communist Manifesto has
> become necessary gives rise to various thoughts.
>
> First of all, it is noteworthy that of late the Manifesto has become
> an index, as it were, of the development of large-scale industry on
> the European continent. In proportion as large-scale industry expands
> in a given country, the demand grows among the workers of that country
> for enlightenment regarding their position as the working class in
> relation to the possessing classes, the socialist movement spreads
> among them and the demand for the Manifesto increases. Thus, not only
> the state of the labour movement but also the degree of development of
> large-scale industry can be measured with fair accuracy in every
> country by the number of copies of the Manifesto circulated in the
> language of that country.
>
> Accordingly, the new Polish edition indicates a decided progress of
> Polish industry. And there can be no doubt whatever that this progress
> since the previous edition published ten years ago has actually taken
> place. Russian Poland, [Congress
> Poland](http://www.marxists.org/glossary/places/c/o.htm#congress-poland){.calibre1},
> has become the big industrial region of the Russian Empire. Whereas
> Russian large-scale industry is scattered sporadically — a part round
> the Gulf of Finland, another in the centre (Moscow and Vladimir), a
> third along the coasts of the Black and Azov seas, and still others
> elsewhere — Polish industry has been packed into a relatively small
> area and enjoys both the advantages and disadvantages arising from
> such concentration. The competing Russian manufacturers acknowledged
> the advantages when they demanded protective tariffs against Poland,
> in spit of their ardent desire to transform the Poles into Russians.
> The disadvantages — for the Polish manufacturers and the Russian
> government — are manifest in the rapid spread of socialist ideas among
> the Polish workers and in the growing demand for the Manifesto.
>
> But the rapid development of Polish industry, outstripping that of
> Russia, is in its turn a new proof of the inexhaustible vitality of
> the Polish people and a new guarantee of its impending national
> restoration. And the restoration of an independent and strong Poland
> is a matter which concerns not only the Poles but all of us. A sincere
> international collaboration of the European nations is possible only
> if each of these nations is fully autonomous in its own house. The
> Revolution of 1848, which under the banner of the proletariat, after
> all, merely let the proletarian fighters do the work of the
> bourgeoisie, also secured the independence of Italy, Germany and
> Hungary through its testamentary executors, Louis Bonaparte and
> Bismarck; but Poland, which since 1792 had done more for the
> Revolution than all these three together, was left to its own
> resources when it succumbed in 1863 to a tenfold greater Russian
> force. The nobility could neither maintain nor regain Polish
> independence; today, to the bourgeoisie, this independence is, to say
> the last, immaterial. Nevertheless, it is a necessity for the
> harmonious collaboration of the European nations. It can be gained
